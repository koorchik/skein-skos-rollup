/**
 * The registry — a SKOS-shaped concept store with provenance (file format v6).
 *
 * Vocabulary follows W3C SKOS and ISO 25964 (iso-thes): each category bucket is a concept scheme,
 * each record a concept whose key is its preferred label; `labels` carry every surface form with
 * per-label provenance (SKOS-XL reading: labels as first-class resources); `definition` is
 * skos:definition; `broaderEdges` are skos:broader relations typed by the ISO 25964 broader-term
 * typology (`broaderGeneric` = BTG/is-a, `broaderPartitive` = BTP/part–whole,
 * `broaderInstantial` = BTI/named instance). Renames and the repair layer are documented
 * extensions with no SKOS equivalent.
 *
 * **The v1 reader is retained deliberately.** `test/fixtures/registry-v1.json` is the M2.5
 * behaviour-preservation reference and must stay in the pre-M3 format; it would be worthless if
 * regenerated through this migration, so `load()` accepts every historical shape (v1–v5) and
 * normalizes it in memory. Committed registries are never rewritten.
 *
 * **Candidate generation lives outside this class** as of M4. The registry keeps storage plus the
 * exact `resolve()` fast path and exposes `snapshot()`; `StringSimilarityGenerator` and friends
 * consume the snapshot. `candidates()` was removed only after the M2.5 gate proved the generator
 * reproduces it byte for byte on all 3,392 frozen pairs.
